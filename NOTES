* Thanks to Alexaner Gladysh (agladysh) for adding the rockspec.
* Thanks to guilespi for adding the pub/sub commands.

* TODO
 * Commands added to Redis since 1.2.2. 
 * The current implementation of non-blocking sockets is a bit
   closely tied to LuaSocket. It might be worth allowing connect
   to take an existing userdata socket, using an external event
   loop rather than polling, etc.
